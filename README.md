# **Subject:** Urgent: Bullying & Hate Speech Complaint â€“ Request for Permanent Account Suspension  

Dear Instagram Support Team,  

My name is Sujoy, and I am reaching out for urgent assistance regarding ongoing harassment on your platform.  

For the past three days, a user has been bullying me and using hateful and offensive language in Hinglish. Despite repeatedly reporting his chat messages and account, no action has been taken. I have also submitted the bullying and harassment report form, hoping for a resolution.  

One of my friends previously reported this user, and his account was temporarily suspended. However, he somehow managed to regain access and resumed bullying me. This has left me feeling extremely distressed, as it seems like there is no permanent solution.  

I have attached multiple screenshots as evidence of the offensive messages he has sent. Additionally, other users have also been targeted, but they are too afraid to report him because he threatens to have their accounts banned if they take action against him.  

My Instagram handle is **@fake_echo.0**, and I have reported his messages multiple times, yet no action has been taken. This has been an ongoing issue, and I no longer feel safe on the platform.  

I kindly request the Instagram team to **permanently suspend his account** so that he cannot continue to harass me or others. Please review the attached screenshots at your earliest convenience. If you need any further information, feel free to contact me via my provided email.  

I sincerely hope you take this matter seriously and help make Instagram a safer place for everyone.  

Thank you for your time and assistance.  

Best regards,  
Sujoy
